# Pytorch Deep Q Network Tutorial

This repository implements the [Pytorch Deep Q Network tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/reinforcement_q_learning.html) and any additional playing around with the tutorial I happen to do. This is not my own idea, it is largely taken from the tutorial. The aim of this project is:

- Familiarize myself with pytorch (coming from using exclusively tensorflow in the past)
- Have a look at reinforcement learning in a neural network context
- Work on a deep Q network problem
